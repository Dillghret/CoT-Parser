From premise (1), we know that at least 5 young teachers are female. This implies that there are at least 5 female teachers who are young. From premise (3), we know that at least 7 young women are teachers. This means that at least 7 young women are either young teachers or young women who are not teachers. Since we already know that at least 5 young teachers are female, we can conclude that there are at least 2 young women who are not teachers. These 2 young women who are not teachers can be either over middle age or middle age.\n\nHowever, premise (2) states that at least 6 female teachers are over middle age, which means that there are at least 6 female teachers who are over middle age. This implies that there are at least 4 young female teachers, as the total number of female teachers is at least 11 (6 over middle age + 5 young). Therefore, we can conclude that at least 4 young female teachers are teachers.\n\nThe premises (1), (2), and (3) support the conclusion that at least 4 young female teachers are teachers.
